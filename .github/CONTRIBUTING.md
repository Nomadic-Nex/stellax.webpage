4. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`.
5. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
6. Submit a pull request and link it to the corresponding issue.

## Code Style & Code Standards

- Ensure that your code is properly formatted and indented.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Write clear and concise comments to explain your code.
