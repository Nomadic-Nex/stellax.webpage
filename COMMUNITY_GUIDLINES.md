## Community Guideline: Respectful and Inclusive Communication

At StellaX Technologies, we believe in fostering a welcoming and inclusive community for all contributors to our open source project. To ensure a positive and respectful environment, we kindly ask all community members to adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Be respectful:** Treat others with kindness, empathy, and respect. Avoid personal attacks, derogatory language, or any form of harassment.

2. **Embrace diversity:** We value diversity in all its forms, including but not limited to race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and disability. Embrace and celebrate our differences.

3. **Constructive feedback:** Provide feedback and suggestions in a constructive manner. Focus on the idea, not the person. Be open to receiving feedback as well.

4. **Keep discussions on-topic:** Stay focused on the project and related topics. Avoid unrelated discussions or spamming.

5. **Be inclusive:** Encourage and support newcomers. Help them feel welcome and guide them in understanding our project's goals and processes.

6. **Follow licensing and copyright:** Respect intellectual property rights and ensure that all contributions comply with the project's licensing requirements.

7. **Report violations:** If you witness any behavior that violates these guidelines, please report it to the project maintainers promptly.

By following these guidelines, we can create a vibrant and inclusive community where everyone feels valued and can contribute to the success of our open source project.

Thank you for being a part of our community!
